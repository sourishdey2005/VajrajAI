# **App Name**: VajraAI

## Core Features:

- Multi-Format FRA Data Import: Enable import of FRA data from various vendors (Omicron, Megger, Doble) in formats like CSV, XML, and proprietary binaries.
- AI-Powered Fault Detection: Use machine learning models to detect anomalies and classify fault types (e.g., axial displacement, radial deformation, core grounding) based on historical FRA signatures. The system should use reasoning to determine the severity.
- Maintenance Recommendation: Suggest actionable maintenance steps based on fault severity and transformer criticality.
- User-Friendly Interface: Develop an intuitive web interface for field engineers and asset managers to interact with the diagnostic software and see an executive summary.
- Interactive Data Visualization: Provide clear and effective data visualization techniques to present fault probability scores.
- Team Section: Implement an interactive section to showcase team members with relevant details.
- Interactive Landing Page: Interactive home landing page for easy navigation and engagement.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep green (#006400) to evoke a sense of clean and green technology and environmental responsibility.
- Background color: Very light green (#F0F8F0), almost white, maintaining a light scheme.
- Accent color: Forest green (#228B22), a close analogue of the primary color but clearly different in brightness and saturation to highlight key interactive elements and maintain consistency with the clean tech theme.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif for headlines; Body font: 'Inter' sans-serif for body; ensuring modern readability with a slight techy feel
- Use minimalistic and clear icons to represent different functionalities and fault types. Icons should align with the clean and green technology theme, possibly incorporating elements like leaves or energy symbols.
- Ensure a clean and responsive layout, with a focus on easy navigation and clear information hierarchy. Incorporate hover effects on interactive elements to improve user experience.
- Implement subtle animations to enhance user engagement, such as loading animations, transitions between sections, and interactive data visualizations.
